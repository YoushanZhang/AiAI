# Visual Question Explanation for Enhanced Course Content Comprehension

** Unlock a new dimension of learning with our innovative web application, designed to transform complex course content into clear and interactive visual question explanations. Engage with an intuitive interface where challenging concepts become accessible and learning becomes an adventure.

## Core Architecture

Our application is built with a robust architecture that ensures a seamless and dynamic user experience. At the heart of this system is app.py, which functions as the critical nexus, orchestrating the flow between our sophisticated Python backend and the responsive web interface.

### Flask Framework Integration

The application leverages Flask, a lightweight and powerful web framework, serving both as the backbone of our server operations and the conduit for our web interactions:

- Templates Directory: Central to our user interface, index.html and other HTML templates reside within the templates directory, facilitating Flask's streamlined rendering process.
- Static Directory: Serving as the repository for our frontend assets, the static directory houses essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, crafting the aesthetics and functionality that enhance the user experience.
