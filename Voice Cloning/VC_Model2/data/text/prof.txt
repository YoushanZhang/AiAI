/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/1.npy|As you guys have probably already noticed that I'm currently an assistant professor at our AI program.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/2.npy|And I will introduce one more of the previous that I developed out of these examples That's exactly how manifold, which means that if we are keeping sampling some samples, from the source domain to the target domain So now, you can see this image in the shoes How monkey changes the interviewer working human being right It's corresponding to those plan dot here So, this is about the time frame of the many goals.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/3.npy|And we also have applications We rely see the he's the animals like here in just about fly heart segmentation The purpose of here is to try to segment the fly heart area And then you can see how this area keeps changes Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/4.npy|And we also have other applications in the cow teat segmentation and classification So again, I just use some results about the cow teat area Those keep in the bounding box to refer to the location, and at this given color segment a teat area And this different number means different classes of the diseases If it is 1, it means normal If it is 2, it means it's abnormal So sometimes, you will see there two there Because the truth is that most of the cows are very healthy Right? Just a few of them can get diseases But then later, you will see a lot of them.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/5.npy|And now we can quickly listen For example, in this case Can you hear anything? But if you look at the Signal here in the left hand, you see a lot of, like, noise, you just bring it over But On your right hand, once you get the denoised, you can see a clear pattern of this sound Right? This is called a realization of the purpose of audio denoising.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/6.npy|And then even further, we have other applications related to the audio separation So, you can also pay attention to these 2 figures, as you can see here Right? See, on the left hand, this figure is about the noisy mixing birds By the right hand, there are 2 different colors So, the yellow color means the bird sound 1, here and the blue color means the bird sound 2 So, this is, um, becomes, becomes an image segmentation problem Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/7.npy|Also, we have other applications that are about audio enhancements As you can see in the left and also in the blue color refers to the noise bird sound and this little bit of this red area refers to the bird sound as you can see from here The original audio is very tiny, very small Right? However, if you apply the audio enhancement you can see it very big It's very annoying that you cannot hear the audio enhanced sounds I'm trying to play it This is actually the denoised bird sound, very tiny This one is pretty big.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/8.npy|Now always, for our online students, if you have any questions, basically, approach to stop me I would like to hear the feedback from you guys Okay? Do not be shy Okay Also, any questions? So now, probably we are starting with our Machine Learning course So that's the first time with the course overview And some things that is very important to all of you, specifically the final score Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/9.npy|So here is the textbook, you guys might need to read It is called like a bible in Machine Learning field In it is like written by the Bishop, the Patent Recognition and Machine Learning And here is an online link, you can click it and download it that is an online free PDF It is not needed to buy the new one, but you can buy a new one if you want to read the text And then this here is just our Canvas page, and you can feel free to have some discussions online.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/10.npy|And again, about our prospect, I think, all of you should have noticed about that Right? Actually, the last latter class is May 10th And our first time is Wednesday, this time, at this location and again the zoom link of the class For, this is the only very good for the online students But for others, I very encourage you guys to come in person Unless you have some good reasons, yes, a good reason And don't say you are too tired Okay.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/11.npy|And we also have office hours It, it is in every Wednesday at 4 - 5 PM And just come to my office I think most of you, you're all of them come to the sixth floor It's at 205 I see some of you guys, but some of you, I did not speak on this matter and then see you guys to come Feel free to stop in the office hour after any kind of questions Okay?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/12.npy|And then again, syllabus, how many of you check out about our syllabus? None of you? Okay That's fine I will also cover about that part.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/13.npy|And I think any of you are from the first semester No? It's from the second semester You should know about this in different data grades Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/14.npy|So now let's talk about passed out today, that is introduction of Machine Learning.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/15.npy|But first of all, for the AI, what is AI? So actually, in one sentence, then more like AI is the science of making intelligent machines which can perform tasks that require intelligence when performed by humans And therefore, important components that is the 'Perception', the Learning, the Abstraction, and Reasoning.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/16.npy|So, first of all, was the Perception of we also can say it as Representation So, in AI, Perception is a process to interpret, acquire, select, and then organize the sensory information from the physical world to make actions like humans.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/17.npy|But what about Learning? So, the Learning is the ability of a system to improve its behavior based on experience So, most likely, it's behavior based on experience Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/18.npy|But the 'Reasoning'? 'Reasoning' is a way to infer facts from existing data It is a general process of thinking rationally, to find valid conclusions What are the differences between Machine Learning and machine reasoning? Right? So, what is about to find patterns? Machine Learning is always to try to find some logical between these patterns, and why the other one is about to understand relationship, it's more like a human being, with seeing a deep understand What was the relationship between them? Like tackling new problems with a deductive and inductive reasoning approach.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/19.npy|So, what about the bottleneck of the AI? So, actually, it's just about the abstraction and the reasoning The key reason is about for the AI is still very difficult for them to make sense of the theory behind all those objects Especially about reasoning and really about understanding the mechanism behind those problems Sometimes it is very difficult for, like, human beings Right? Especially about deductive and inactive If you want Machine Learning to do some tasks that have never turned before, it is very challenging for them.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/20.npy|So next, I want to briefly mention about the history of the Machine Learning.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/21.npy|So, definitely, you know, we will go back to a long time ago Right? It's like 70 years or so ago, but that is in the 1950s, the first light of Machine Learning is very related to the checker player So out of that, in the 1960s, like the earliest offer of the neural network, it's called Perceptron as it was born at that time However, after that, it was proven that Perceptron is not working So then, we'll be able to expand more reasons about their products In the 1970s, we also have other coming algorithms.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/22.npy|So, then, let's go back to the 1980s So, we have advanced Decision Tree and the Rule Learning after the previous Later in the 1990s, so, in this case, we will have more bulk view of Machine Learning like that There's a mark, finding some text and learning, some Reinforcement Learning and Inductive Logic Programming, etcetera.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/23.npy|Even recently like in the 2000s This is like a majority of traditional Machine Learning algorithms that are already invented At that time, for example, the Support Vector Machine, the kernel methods, the graphical methods, statistical relational learning, from transfer learning, etcetera And then, it includes you like knowledge about 10 years ago in the 2010s In that stage and like Deep Learning is ready and becomes popular Right? So, out of that, in the next decade, like 2010, the Deep Learning is most likely everyday work So, it going to increase that economy.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/24.npy|Next, I would like to introduce what is Machine Learning And why should we study? How we care about Machine Learning? Right?
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/25.npy|Have you ever thought? How easily we can recognize face, the color, the shape or handwritten characters How will the children learn to balance or develop preference to some taste Right? I don't know whether guys have some time to think about that, or even like human's cognitive abilities have transformed every aspect of our lives And the human mind is a set of cognitive gadgets, and specialized to learn.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/26.npy|For example, can we manually write an algorithm or hard code that caters all the variations? Like traditional methods, can they do that? Probably very challenging Right? Because different possess of cats Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/27.npy|Very challenging I mean, different shape, strange shape Somehow has the cat more like water It can be in any shape Right? So that means that you need to test your very challenge with that environment.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/28.npy|So now, we talk about the question So, what is the Machine Learning? And this is very about it The early stages of computers in 1959, so the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/29.npy|And this guy says that Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience And then in this case, we'll care more about automatically Right? That is important because we want save our time because we are human beings Right? And well lazy, we cannot do everything, we want some computer to do that.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/30.npy|And the Machine Learning algorithms ingest data and model, like, more like the hypothesis So, the learned model can be used to detect the patterns, detect the trends, detect the structures, etc from data set. And then we make predictions on unseen or the new data set And the letter when we will talk more about those unknown applications.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/31.npy|You will try to use Machine Learning For example, in the speech recognition For example, you'll use Siri and ask her to do something for you Right? To customize, to find something for you like in the speech recognition.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/32.npy|And also, in the visual recognition with Machine Learning to try to recognize whether this is a dog or whether it's a cat Okay.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/33.npy|And also, about the face detection to recognize where in the face, again, those kinds of bounding box Right? And also, about the expression recognition of whether you are happy or whether you are sad, right? We have some different things.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/34.npy|And also, we can recognize the handwritten digits For example, this kind of very weird Right? It is weird Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/35.npy|And also, like, self-driving cars care about autonomous driving Right? So, this is all about some bigger data stuff.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/36.npy|And even we can use Machine Learning to help us explore something that not exist For example, the navigation task because our human has never been there before, right? Who can use some robot machine help us be explored first Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/37.npy|What about another category is Unsupervised Learning, like categories and techniques For example, Clustering, the k-means clustering, the Mean-shift clustering, the Spectral clustering The Density estimation function, like GMM the Gaussian mixture model, the Graphical model And the data dimensionality, the Dimensionality reduction method, like the PCA, like Factor analysis So, all of those are some Unsupervised Learning.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/38.npy|So then, we will move to the application field.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/39.npy|And even we can try to analyze your posture, I mean this kind In the left hand is about a human and the right hand just tries to show a posture.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/40.npy|And we also have another semantic recommendation about lab aids, just images On the right hand, just a couple of some labels of these different objects like the cars, the roads, the trees Right? All different kinds of labels, yes?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/41.npy|Also, there is another one about the medical image segmentation So, the left one just is one MRI image So, left hand, we try to segment this white matter of perimeter of it That is the blue color The center has the yellow color and the red color here.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/42.npy|Now, also, for those care about the stock So, this is about the stock price prediction Albeit Right? I can also use Machine Learning to do that.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/43.npy|And also, there are lots of revolution in the robotics nowadays Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/44.npy|And this is the users for robotics in an inventory of manufacturing like the automotive and also about is this packaging staff.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/45.npy| And also, there are other kinds of military or government robots as iRobot PackBot a kind of bot, and the Remotec Andros about those different machines.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/46.npy|A soldier robot throws some bombs to human being So, this is like, I'd say like the UAV, the aerial drones And also, about the military suit All about this case try to do some detection some problem of it.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/47.npy|And also, you know about the space robot that I mentioned before to try to explore the Mars Right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/48.npy|And also, we have some laboratory applications like the drug discovery, a test tube sorting So, all, about can be some useful to us in a laboratory.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/49.npy|And this is the famous sentence from Bill Gates that A Breakthrough in Machine Learning will be worth ten Microsofts Is that true? I think, right?.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/50.npy|I guess, this many the most content that we have today So next, probably I will talk some kind of potential work you guys can do when you try to finish this course, a typical street kind of open job.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/51.npy|Any more questions? What about our online students? Any questions about you guys? Any question? No? Okay What about the homework? Otherwise, clear about? Okay That's good If not, so then, our class is finished today, and you guys have a good night, and now I hope I'll see more of you next week Okay? Thank you Thank you, sir.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/52.npy|Now what is the plane for you for next step.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/53.npy|use it first step use it lets test it was binary fist lets see how that is improved but atleast.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/54.npy|Yes first try with binary segmentation lets see what the.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/55.npy|do it first do it one by one.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/56.npy|so Finish this one then we talk about next step.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/57.npy|let him try the binary segmentation first lets see whats the results here.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/58.npy|yeah but anyway i cant see the real screen.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/59.npy|as i said last time you focus on majorly hosted from here.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/60.npy|This seems the page is a littlebit the possible can you make the bigger.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/61.npy|So as i said next time first host in desktop so now i think for this you see is annoying reason.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/62.npy|So next time hosted in the desktop so that it would be easier.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/63.npy|you can go back to update here so in this case it takes while so that we dont how what is happeing here.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/64.npy|yes because now it just waste of time because see i believe you changed something but we cannt see it right.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/65.npy|I mean you could use that weight is you have a test did you did you have a test or not yet.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/66.npy|overall it seems fine but it just about the last section of the.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/67.npy|Yeah, I see the similar videos that.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/68.npy|Yes, that's fine. So but as I said, let's let him try them.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/69.npy|Finally, it's commentation first. Let's see what's the results here.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/70.npy|For the fire. What is a previous one?
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/71.npy|But anyway, I cannot see the screen. Anyway, so then let's.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/72.npy|So what about your website part.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/73.npy|Did you change that or not Not yet.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/74.npy|So next time, maybe I will talk to you later for the next time. But for this one, yes, you can shoot now for us. Yeah, Professor, the homepage I updated the, the team background, everything I updated.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/75.npy|So now I click the more the same as the pages are a little bit smaller. Can you make it a bigger.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/76.npy|Yes, yes, Professor. But once you click that again, it doesn't work right, learn more or after you click on the more it changes to another button, show less like that.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/77.npy|So now, you have still have the more here it seems weird once you click a.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/78.npy|So now once you click you cannot click it again right.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/79.npy|But anyway, Jesse's out of the park.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/80.npy|Check the description why I did not change.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/81.npy|So as I said, next time, first the host in the desktop. So now I think is because this, you see is a knowing reason is just a big compiling is rebuilding there.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/82.npy|So next time host the desktop so that it will be easier, right.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/83.npy|So yes, so that's the reason I said that next time, please do host it from desktop not here. Did you call that part.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/84.npy|Okay, good. So now who is the next group.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/85.npy|Yes, you can try to level one more data set if you think some part is not covered. It is possible.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/86.npy|That's fine. So the year edition, I got the update that for the grant proposal part. Overall, overall it seems fine but it's just about the last section of the.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/87.npy|only in the left section. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That GPU stuff, it seems still is not that convincing, right? So you probably need to emphasize, for example, you need to emphasize why. So this time we use, we want to purchase H100 instead of A100. So why we want to use H100 instead of A100? Because A100 is about proposed around three years ago, is a little bit low in terms of our new LM, this kind of 99 models, right? So recently the H100 GPU should be more suitable for us. And also you need to emphasize that we may sometimes, in this case, we may only pursue the eight, 800, right? So in this case, it might not able to trim a large-language model from scratch, right? So it's all design our own large-language model, because typically it needs tons of GPUs, right? But now we just, we have few. But in this case, we can feel free to fine tune some LLMs, right? So in that case, you need to emphasize a little bit about that part.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/88.npy|or you can emphasize how to use or develop some small size of large language model that is also can be fit for our case.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/89.npy|Yes, I mean you definitely need to check about changing to H 100. Why we want to H 100 instead of a 100 here.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/90.npy|Yeah, so let's say this time we only have eight. Can we still try some kind of reasonable small modern rate LMS?
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/91.npy|But at least the fine tuning should be there shouldn't be any problem. Yeah, fine tuning should not be a problem. But in terms of retrain, if we have a very large number of datasets, I was still doubt about that part.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/92.npy|Yeah, it's better to give a little bit of estimation. For example, if we have 10 megabytes of data set.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/93.npy|This can be some reasonable numbers, some reasonable data set that you could train on smaller.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/94.npy|TPUs yeah check about this part so that graph it should be fine.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/95.npy|Yeah, this is not an automatic issue. You have to click a small button. Yes or no.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/96.npy|Yes, yes. Yeah, remove that apart. So once someone click on that, we.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/97.npy|watch this demo video so then it can automatically play that. You do not need to click on the small button again.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/98.npy|Next time, or you can send me, I'll have the link. So later I will check the text there. Basically, this is more like, and you guys need to prepare how to write down this kind of website. It's like a kind of a summarizing of this project.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/99.npy|Okay, that's fine. Let's go. Okay. Could you elaborate on the role of PPA? What's this? Using gradient descent. Why is it has a gradient descent? Learning of classification.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/100.npy|Okay, so next time you can show me a results about only about training and only about training. Only about training and the test so separate them so that we can know because we usually expect that is a training part it should be. very good right but it may be very poor. Let's say how poor it is.
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/101.npy|Why is the war you shouldn't care about other people's code, right? So we have to, I can't use that computer.
