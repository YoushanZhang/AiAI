"Researchers at the Katz School, led by Honggang Wang, are working on an innovative AI-powered wearable device that can track and detect illicit drug use in individuals struggling with substance use disorder.","Wang's research paper introduces RP STREAM, an algorithm that analyzes data from the device to accurately identify instances of drug use."
"In order to create their model, the researchers gathered data from individuals who had a history of cocaine use and were equipped with a wearable biosensor known as Affectiva Q.","This device is capable of monitoring a range of physiological changes including electrodermal activity, physical activity, and body temperature."
"To determine instances of cocaine use, the researchers examined patient records, urine tests, and data collected from the biosensor.","While some studies have been effective in identifying drug use patterns, they typically analyze data over extended periods of time."
Wang noted that detecting drug use is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors.,"This innovative new method is able to detect drug use in shorter time intervals, similar to analyzing a movie frame by frame rather than all at once."
"The team, led by Prof Wang, shared their findings at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE International Conference on Connected Health Applications Systems and Engineering Technologies.","The team included colleagues Joshua Rumbut and Hua Fang from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, as well as Edward Boyer from Ohio State University and Harvard Medical School."
The RP STREAM algorithm utilizes real-time precision pattern recognition to accurately detect polysubstance use episodes in wearable biosensor data streams.,"By incorporating rules derived from previous research, the algorithm effectively distinguishes between different substances and identifies substance use episodes with accuracy."
"Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an intelligent threshold-setting mechanism to differentiate between substance use episodes and other anomalies in the biosensor data.","Wang stated that the current methods for identifying substance use relapses are inadequate, as they often fail to account for varying durations and patterns of use that occur over several days."
This limits their effectiveness in real-world situations where substance use behaviors are not consistent.,"Medical professionals typically rely on testing urine or blood samples to determine drug use, but these methods may not provide accurate timing information."
"Additionally, individuals may intentionally deceive or simply forget about their drug use.","In a recent study, RP STREAM successfully detected instances of cocaine and cannabis use, with episodes lasting an average of a few minutes."
"In a comparison to another method, RP STREAM was found to be more accurate in detecting substance abuse by avoiding false alarms.",Wang expressed a desire to further develop this method to enhance its ability to identify substance use in new participants.
This research is crucial in gaining insights into the factors that contribute to substance abuse and potentially predicting instances of relapse.,"At the Zahava and Moshael Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought, we explore how individuals' tolerance to drugs evolves over time in real-world scenarios."

"Throughout the day, a series of seminars delved into diverse themes, texts, and questions that explored the intersection of Torah with various cultural and political aspects of Western thought.",This provided a glimpse into the wide range of topics covered in Straus Center courses.
"In his seminar titled ""Torah and Western Thought: The Ethos of the YU Straus Center,"" Rabbi Meir Soloveichik, the Director of the Straus Center, discussed the significant influence of the Torah on Western civilization, surpassing that of any other text.",", Rabbi Soloveichik passionately highlighted the transformative power of the Torah's worldview in shaping America's future, emphasizing its crucial role as a foundational pillar of the country's origins."
"Trapedo's discussion on Psalms and the American Founding encouraged students to consider how current auction prices of literary works, such as the Shakespeare Folio, the Bay Psalm Book, and the Codex Sasson Bible, offer insight into society's perceptions of wisdom and its monetary and moral worth in the 21st century.","The following session, ""Torah and Art: Yetziat Mitzrayim and the Birth of Jewish Political Thought,"" included a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Rabbi Soloveichik."
"During the tour, Rabbi Soloviechik highlighted the significance of often overlooked artifacts and hieroglyphics in the Egyptian collection, shedding light on the political aspects of the Exodus.","He discussed how elements such as the Paschal lamb, the ten plagues, and the iconic unleavened bread of the Seder have been central to Jewish life and faith for centuries."
"After the tour, Neil Rogachevsky, Straus Center Associate Director and author of ""Israel Declaration of Independence: The History and Political Theory of the Nation's Founding Document,"" led a session on Torah, Zionism, and the Israel Declaration.","He stressed the significance of the Declaration from a political standpoint, noting that without a political entity, the Zionist movement could have come to a standstill."
"Although the Declaration could have ideally provided a more detailed plan for the future state of Israel, it was ultimately created out of necessity.","In his session on Torah, Literature, Myth, and Monotheism, Rabbi Dov Lerner, Clinical Assistant Professor at the Straus Center, delved into the concept of monotheism and the importance of the consistent emphasis found in Tanakh and daily liturgy on the oneness of God."
"Rabbi Lerner highlighted the risks associated with a Dualistic society, where the belief in separate good and bad deities only serves to complicate rather than resolve the age-old theological problem of theodicy.","Believing in one God is crucial for recognizing that, despite the complexities and uncertainties of the world, God is both all-powerful and beyond human understanding."
"In the final sessions of the respective seminars, a panel discussion was held with Straus Scholars Allie Orgen (SCW), Yonatan Kurz (YC), and Reuben Hartman (YC).","They shared insights into their favorite aspects of the Straus Scholar program, discussed the diverse classes and seminars they participated in, and talked about the leadership roles, fellowships, and internships they engaged in during their time in the program."

What aspects of each program did you find most appealing?,I particularly enjoyed AEI as it provided valuable insights into the Middle East and offered perspectives on how America should navigate its national security interests in the region.
"Engaging with American interests does not equate to isolationism or non-interventionism, nor does it entail seeking global domination.",It is important to strike a balance in our approach.
This experience was particularly enlightening for me as it shed light on Middle Eastern countries that I had previously overlooked.,"Understanding their economies, cultures, and geopolitical interests is crucial in safeguarding Israeli security."
"On the final day of the AEI program, I was fortunate to listen to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.",His insights into the intersection of law and national security sparked a deeper contemplation of how these two fields can be effectively combined.
"The Hudson program spanned an incredible six weeks, during which I had the opportunity to connect with fellow participants and experts in the field of foreign policy.","These individuals are the driving forces behind American foreign policy, and I was able to engage with them, gain insights, and potentially even shape their perspectives through thoughtful questioning."
Did any particular scholars leave a lasting impact on you with their classes?,I found value in every course I took and gained knowledge from all of my teachers.
"I found my studies in criminal justice with John Walters, President of Hudson, to be particularly engaging.","Additionally, learning about the Iranian threat with Michael Doran, Director of the Center for Middle East at Hudson, provided valuable insights."
"One highlight was the opportunity to participate in policy workshop simulations, such as modeling a National Security Council meeting.",Professionals such as Doran provide valuable insights by highlighting the potential challenges policymakers may face when forming positions on various issues.
This experience shed light on the complexities involved in making informed foreign policy decisions.,Navigating through numerous complex elements and conflicting priorities leaves us with limited straightforward options.
"Additionally, we were privileged to learn from a diverse group of esteemed speakers who provided valuable insights into various aspects of public policy and public engagement on a global scale.","Among the speakers at the event, General Jack Keane and Senator Tom Cotton left a lasting impression on me."
"General Keane's in-depth analysis of the various threats facing America, particularly from major geopolitical players like Russia and China, highlighted the expertise and knowledge required to navigate the complex issues that the country must address in order to safeguard its citizens and promote freedom globally.","Senator Cotton shared his personal experiences in the military and how they have influenced his character and values, highlighting the selfless sacrifice that service members make for their country."
His words were truly inspiring and served as a reminder of the dedication and commitment of those who serve their fellow citizens.,I am grateful to the Straus Center for providing me with valuable opportunities for growth and development.
"During my time in Washington DC, learning from policy scholars and engaging with my peers, I was reminded of the valuable perspective that Torah Jews can offer to the wider world.",It became clear to me how a Torah perspective can truly influence policy making in the political hub of Washington.
"Marian Gidea, the associate dean for STEM research and director of graduate mathematics at the Katz School, recently presented groundbreaking research at the esteemed International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics in Tokyo.","His study revealed that oscillating steel beams, constructed with piezoelectric materials, generate more energy when their motion is consistent and regular."
"The computer model was a collaborative effort between Tamar Leiser, a former student at YU Stern School for Women who wrote her honors thesis on the subject, Ph.D. student Samuel Akingbade from Katz School of Mathematics, and research collaborators from Georgia Tech and Polytechnic University of Catalunya.","Together, they developed a framework that involved suspending two steel beams over magnets and connecting them to a capacitor."
Gidea expressed that the electricity generated and stored in the capacitor is a result of the beams vibrating more strongly than mechanical friction.,It was surprising to discover that the expected outcome matched the actual result.
Consistent and rhythmic movement of beams generates more energy compared to chaotic movement.,"Energy harvesting devices that utilize external vibrations can be installed on skyscrapers, trains, or bridges to create a sustainable source of renewable energy."
Piezoelectric energy harvesting is especially well-suited for wearable devices as it can efficiently generate power on a small scale.,"The steel beams in the Katz School model were coated with ceramic, the ideal material for energy harvesting due to its cost-effectiveness and efficient piezoelectric properties."
"By harnessing piezoelectricity, the need for frequent charging of devices and batteries can be significantly reduced or eliminated altogether.","This development could greatly benefit consumers by freeing them from the need to constantly be near an electrical outlet, ultimately leading to energy conservation."
"Additionally, this could have significant implications for healthcare, as these devices have the potential to be implanted in pacemakers to help regulate heart stimulation, according to Gidea.","When a clear drinking glass is filled two-thirds of the way with water and a straw is placed inside the glass at an angle, it may appear as though the straw is broken in two."
This optical illusion occurs due to the bending or refraction of light as it crosses the boundary from air to water.,"Fredy Zypman, the director of the M A in Physics program at the Katz School, recently published a research paper that delves into the fundamental basis of a simple phenomenon."
"In his paper ""Permittivity from First Principles,"" published in September by AIP Advances, Zypman explores the relationship between refraction and its atomic origins.","He also introduces a mathematical model aimed at providing a deeper understanding of permittivity, a property closely linked to the process of refraction."
"Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when light transitions from one medium to another, causing it to change speed and direction.",The index of refraction quantifies this change by comparing the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in a specific substance.
"According to Zypman, the materials in our surroundings, such as plastics, liquids, and the air, possess distinct electrical properties.","When an electrical field transitions from one medium to another, light must adapt to the new environment."
"This is why we observe shadows and reflections, which are abundant sources of visual experiences in our surroundings.","Transparent materials such as glass, water, and diamonds refract light more than air does."
This causes the path of light to bend towards an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the water when it enters from air.,Bending of light occurs only when it crosses a boundary within a material due to the uniform refractive index.
"This refractive index is determined by the material's atomic electric response, specifically its polarizability and ability to separate positive and negative charges in response to electric fields, as explained by Zypman.",Polarizability can be understood as the ability of an atom's electrons to shift or become distorted in response to an electric field.
"This distortion leads to an increase in electric polarization, which in turn affects the material's permittivity.",Permittivity is a measure of how much a material resists or opposes an electric field.
"Our goal was to establish a clear connection between atomic polarization and the phenomenon of refraction,"" he explained.","The primary objective of the research is to develop precise equations for permittivity at all levels of an electric field, applicable to any intensity of light, and to calculate the permittivity for common materials."
"After just two weeks into her clinical rotation at St. John Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens, Carin Gannon, a student in the Katz School M in Physician Assistant Studies, faced a challenging situation.","A local resident had sustained a deep cut on his leg from a piece of glass and was brought to the emergency department, bleeding heavily."
"After undergoing an X-ray to ensure there was no glass remaining in the wound, the patient was returned to the emergency department where Gannon and Abraham Oxilas, a clinical assistant professor at Katz School, were waiting.","Gannon, who had not practiced suturing in Oxilas' Clinical Skills and Procedures course for several months, knew that the wound had not yet begun to heal from within after two hours since the injury occurred."
"As she observed the yellowish subcutaneous fatty tissue, she took the necessary precautions by washing her hands with soap, donning a pair of sterile gloves, and preparing a suturing kit.","Carefully, she irrigated the wound with sterile water and administered seven injections of lidocaine to numb the area before beginning the suturing process."
"Oxilas began the sewing process by making the first stitch, then passed the needle to Gannon.","With Oxilas supervising closely and Gannon working diligently, the task was completed with care and precision."
to perform the task because of my experience working on a silicone model in class.,"However, I didn't want to reveal that it was my first time suturing a live patient."
"Despite my nerves, I knew I had to step up and give it my all.",I had to rely on my muscle memory to guide me.
"Taking the needle shaped like a crescent moon for suturing, she carefully held the two sides of the wound together as she stitched them up.","Just as intricate as needlework, suturing involves a range of techniques."
"Gannon utilized the interrupted stitch method, in which each stitch is secured with a surgeon's knot.",She carefully tightened the knots to securely hold the wound closed without causing it to pucker.
"While most simple lacerations can be quickly stitched up in minutes, Gannon spent half an hour carefully sewing seven stitches to close the man's wound.","""It appeared more polished than when I rehearsed it in class,"" she remarked."
"""I understand that it may seem like a minor task for PAs to perform every day, but when it's your first time doing it, it can be quite exhilarating to execute those skills.""","After receiving care from Gannon, the patient was advised to monitor his wound for any signs of infection, such as redness spreading up or down his leg."
Gannon also cautioned the patient against using alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound.,"In addition to a tetanus shot, the patient was prescribed antibiotics and allowed to return home."
"""Oxilas praised Carin for her exceptional interpersonal skills, expertise, and ability to quickly adjust to new situations.","Her previous experiences in hospitals have enabled her to excel in the emergency room during her first rotation, and I am incredibly proud of her."""
Gannon dedicates three hours a week to commuting on the subway from the Bronx to Far Rockaway.,"During her journey, she immerses herself in the music of her favorite artists Hozier and Noah Kahan."
"On her return trip, she diligently takes notes on patient diagnoses, tests, procedures, and medications while the information is still fresh in her mind.","Upon completion of her clinical rotation, she will undergo a comprehensive examination in class to assess her understanding of the material."
"Oxilas praised the Katz School PA program for its dedication to training PAs in cultural competence, enabling them to deliver effective healthcare to underserved communities with diverse needs.","Our students at the Katz School PA program are dedicated to providing comprehensive care for patients, encompassing everything from creating treatment plans and performing procedures to simple tasks like fetching a blanket."
"Gannon emphasized that the program has taught her to consider all aspects of patient care, including physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs, in order to facilitate recovery.","She is set to graduate in December and eagerly looks forward to her upcoming clinical rotation, where she will gain exposure to different disciplines like endocrinology or pediatrics."
"She aims to explore various fields before deciding on a career path, but at the moment, her passion lies in emergency care.",Gannon found working in the emergency department and witnessing the impact of PAs to be truly inspiring.
He has a deep passion for critical care.,"I enjoy engaging with trauma patients in urban areas, and my six years of experience in the emergency department have been invaluable."
"Rabbi Kook is often regarded as a significant figure for Israeli religious Zionists, akin to the influence Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik had on modern orthodox American Jews.","The similarities between Rav Kook and the Rav are striking, as both are considered the preeminent thinkers of modern Judaism in the 20th century."
"They delved into crucial concepts of Jewish nationality, identity, Zionism, and engaged in deep contemplation on how to effectively engage with secularism.",The writings of Rabbi Kook can be complex and challenging to decipher at times.
There are instances where his works may appear to be in conflict with each other.,"Can you provide an overview of the course's methodology and discuss the literary works studied in class, particularly those written by Rav Kook?"
"His writing encompasses a mix of essayistic and exegetical styles, with a significant portion taking the form of personal reflections in diary format.",The personal writings found in Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook and Rabbi David Cohen's preserved notebooks and letters offer valuable insights into their lives and teachings.
"The writings were intended for a specific audience with a background in mystical training, making them challenging for the general public to understand.","Rav Kook's writings can be challenging to comprehend, requiring readers to carefully analyze the text to understand its message and intended audience."
Much of the course involved deep reading and interpretation to uncover the significance of each piece.,"During our exploration, we delved into essays penned by Rav Kook that contained some of his most daring ideas, many of which were not published during his lifetime."
Our main focus was on Rav Kook's writings about the philosophy of halakha.,"In Rabbi David Cohen's compilation ""Orot HaKodesh,"" which contains Rav Kook's philosophical writings, we examined his perspective on the nature of knowledge, the world, and ethics."
"At Yeshiva University, we prioritize the integration of Torah study and Jewish tradition with secular knowledge.","This approach is rooted in the teachings of Rav Kook, who believed that all ideas contain elements of truth."
"He recognized the strengths and limitations of conflicting religious ideologies, such as those between Hassidic and Misnagdic traditions.","This open-minded approach extended to his views on secular Zionism, making his perspective on diverse philosophies a key aspect of his teachings."
Rav Kook embraced the practice of finding merit in the secular Zionists who were often hostile towards religion.,"He recognized that their rejection of certain aspects of Jewish tradition, formed in the diaspora, was due to a desire to break free from passivity and isolation in the study halls, and engage more actively in the wider society."
"Rav Kook gained an appreciation for the positive efforts of those cultivating Israel, despite their rejection of religion, which he believed stemmed from a narrow perspective.",He viewed their modern activism as a necessary correction to the passive attitudes of diasporic Jews.
"In terms of what students should take away from the course, it is important for them to have a deep understanding of Rav Kook himself, rather than just relying on hearsay.",The focus is on developing critical thinking skills.
We analyzed the extent to which his arguments were based on assumptions about the people of his time.,This helps students gain a deeper understanding of the issues people faced in the 19th century.
"Lastly, it encourages readers to not be afraid to engage with the material themselves and form their own opinions.","On Wednesday, May, Yeshiva University's Zahava and Moshael Straus Center for Torah and Western Thought, Rabbi Arthur Schneier Program for International Affairs, and Bernard Revel Graduate School of Judaic Studies, in collaboration with the Mohamed Bin Zayed University for Humanities, hosted a groundbreaking event that brought together cultures and religious identities at the Crossroads of Civilization Museum in Dubai."
"The program, titled ""Interacting Philosophies, Shared Friendships,"" commenced with opening remarks from Ahmed Obaid Al Mansoori, the founder of the museum.",He referenced a teaching from the Quran which emphasizes the importance of understanding and connecting with people from various backgrounds.
"Mansoori highlighted that building relationships with different cultures and religions is a core belief in Islam, and the conference aimed to embody this principle.",Rabbi Stuart Halpern then extended warm greetings on behalf of the Office of the Provost and the Straus Center.
"He delved into the significance of Sefirat Ha Omer, the Jewish tradition of counting the days from enslavement in Egypt to the Revelation at Sinai.","Rabbi Halpern explained that this practice of counting up, rather than down, symbolizes our aspiration towards greater heights while staying connected to our roots."
"Tonight, as we come together, we honor the rich history of our Jewish and Islamic communities, looking towards a promising future.","After the opening remarks from the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Fleur Hassan Nahoum, Revel dean Daniel Rynhold commenced the evening with the first lecture of the program."
"During the discussion on Maimonides and the Parable of the Sultan Palace, a contextual analysis was provided on how the parable, found at the end of Maimonides' major philosophical work The Guide for the Perplexed, likely mirrors Maimonides' own struggle to balance his medical and communal obligations with his pursuit of divine contemplation.","Following this, Ibrahim Burshashen presented a talk in Arabic on the significant influence that the Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd had on Maimonides' Guide."
"Burshashen's colleague Haider Hussain further explored the topic by discussing The Role and Impact of Islamic Civilization on Jewish Philosophy, using Moses Ben Maimon as a key example of the joint interaction between the two cultures.","He emphasized the profound value and humility that comes from studying the dynamic exchanges between Jewish and Islamic cultures, concluding with a heartfelt blessing for Maimonides."
The final speakers from Yeshiva University were Ronnie Perelis from the Schneier Program and Shira Weiss from the Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks Herenstein Center for Values and Leadership.,Perelis discussed the historical interactions between Jewish and Muslim communities in a global society.
He highlighted the role of Arabic as a common language that facilitated connections and commerce between people of different faiths in cities like Baghdad and Basra.,"Perelis went on to explain how Judeo-Arabic had a profound impact on Jewish engagement with Arabic culture, shaping Jewish literature, grammar, linguistics, and poetry."
"He expressed hope for further transformations to occur through our interactions, emphasizing the importance of listening to and appreciating others on their own terms, sharing our experiences and challenges, and collaborating to find solutions together.","Weiss provided an insightful analysis of how Ibn Rushd influenced the philosophy of Joseph Albo in his book, ""The Influence of Ibn Rushd on the Philosophy of Joseph Albo."""
"By focusing on Albo's work, ""The Book of Principles,"" Weiss highlighted how Ibn Rushd inspired Albo to articulate three fundamental principles: the acknowledgment of God, the truth of prophecy, and the concept of reward and punishment.",Weiss also acknowledged the role of divinity as a blessing from God in shaping Albo's philosophical beliefs.
Visiting Abu Dhabi the day after the conference was truly enlightening.,"Our group had the opportunity to tour the newly constructed synagogue in the Abrahamic Family House, meet with officials at the Ministry of Tolerance, and participate in the historic celebration of Israel Independence Day in the UAE."
Straus Scholars Program has played a vital role in broadening my intellectual horizons and offering me distinctive educational experiences that have influenced my beliefs and empowered me in both my religious and academic journeys.,The UAE experience was truly enlightening and I feel honored to have been part of events that will shape a positive future for Muslim-Jewish relations.
"Weiss reflected on the YU conference with Mohamed Bin Zayed University as a valuable opportunity for members of both universities and attendees from the Muslim and Jewish communities in Dubai to come together, share ideas, foster connections, and explore potential collaborations.","In addition to the conference, visits to the Ministry of Tolerance and the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, which houses a mosque, church, and synagogue, as well as attending the Israeli Embassy's celebration of Israel, provided a fascinating look at the promising future of relationships and partnerships in the UAE."
The generous donation of one million dollars to Yeshiva University will create the Lea and Leon Eisenberg Writing Center at Stern College for Women.,"This center is a tribute to the memory of Lea and Leon YC Eisenberg, and was established by their children, Larry Eisenberg of Los Angeles, CA, Richard Eisenberg of Lawrence, NY, and Reva Hirsch of Lawrence, NY, who serve as directors of the Eisenberg Family Foundation."
"Lea and Leon Eisenberg, residents of Long Beach and Lawrence NY, were dedicated philanthropists who had a strong passion for Jewish continuity, education, and supporting Yeshiva University.","Their generous gift is helping to advance Rise Up The Campaign, a comprehensive initiative aimed at providing scholarships, improving facilities, and supporting faculty to ensure the continued success of the University."
"Mrs. Eisenberg dedicated many years to serving as the chair of the Stern College for Women Board of Overseers, and remained actively involved both before and after her tenure.","Together with Leon Yu, she established the Lea and Leon Eisenberg Beit Midrash at Stern College and generously supported other initiatives at Stern College, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), and Yeshiva University."
The newly established Lea and Leon Eisenberg Writing Center on Beren Campus will significantly improve the services and offerings of the current writing center.,It will be conveniently located next to the Shevet Glaubach Center for Career Strategy and Professional Development.
"In addition to providing students with personalized tutoring in various forms of writing, such as college essays, marketing papers, and lab reports, the center will also offer assistance with crafting cover letters and personal statements for job applications and graduate school.",I was fortunate to work closely with Lea during her time on the Stern College Board of Overseers.
"Her insightful guidance and the strong partnership she shared with her husband Leon served as a source of inspiration for me, noted Dean Karen Bacon, who holds the position of Mordecai D. Katz and Monique C. Katz Dean of the Undergraduate Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yeshiva University.",Lea understood the significance of carefully chosen and heartfelt words.

"Akingbade is developing a mathematical model to optimize the external force applied to energy harvesting devices, such as oscillating beams in structures like skyscrapers, trains, and bridges.","This model aims to overcome the internal friction that inhibits the beams from vibrating, thus maximizing the production of electric charge from piezoelectric materials."
Three researchers from the Katz School specializing in mathematics and physics have created a theoretical model to forecast the shapes and gravitational forces of asteroids.,"Their findings, which were published in the prestigious journal Astrophysics and Space Science in March, could prove invaluable for engineers designing spacecraft landings on irregularly shaped celestial bodies."
This groundbreaking research was made possible through a generous grant from the National Science Foundation.,The primary challenge we faced in our research was developing mathematical expressions to accurately represent the varying gravitational forces on irregularly shaped asteroids.
"Unlike on Earth, gravity on these objects is not consistent.","This was a collaborative effort led by Fredy Zypman, a physics professor, along with Marian Gidea, a mathematics professor, and Wai Ting Lam, a former doctoral student in mathematics who is now a faculty member at Yeshiva University Stern College for Women."
It is important to understand the complexities of gravity on asteroids of different shapes in order to gain a deeper insight into their behavior in the solar system.,Scientists and explorers are particularly intrigued by these areas due to their abundance of minerals.
Lam noted that the study of the unique gravity fields is truly captivating.,"The researchers at the Katz School studied asteroids and comets that have a dumbbell or peanut shape, which can result in varying gravitational fields across their surfaces due to uneven mass distribution."
"This is in contrast to Earth, which has a more uniform mass distribution and therefore a relatively constant gravitational field.","""Dumbbells are one of the unique shapes that researchers have observed in comets and asteroids, making them intriguing from both astronomical and mathematical perspectives,"" stated Gidea."
"Due to the complex gravitational field of asteroids, spacecrafts must approach them with caution and precision to navigate their irregularities.","Some unique examples of irregularly shaped asteroids include Hektor, the largest Jupiter Trojan asteroid with its own moon, Comet Hartley, which was the focus of a NASA Deep Impact spacecraft flyby, and the trans-Neptunian object Arrokoth (Ultima Thule) in the Kuiper Belt, which was the target of the New Horizons space probe flyby."
"Furthermore, in addition to the overall findings regarding the effects of gravity on peanut-shaped objects, we have developed a model to describe the shape of Hektor using straightforward equations.",Gidea explains that this formula offers a range of potential shapes for this particular type of asteroid.
Not all peanut-shaped asteroids are the same.,"We needed to determine the quantity and variety of these shapes, and then calculate the gravitational force at different points near them."
"Zypman explained that the researchers also examined how an asteroid's shape evolves with its rotation, shedding light on the object's formation process when it was still flexible and taking on its current form.","""Currently, the data is not available."""
